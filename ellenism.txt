"Ellenism" is the name i have chosen for the belief (factual in the Jay Universe) set that orbits the god Yaldabaoth. A lot of its main scripture was written, or edited, by the Scholar Beazlebux.

(It is based on the Christian God in a way, but incredibly different)

GODS:
1. Rey: the most powerful god ever in ellenism, on level with that of Gojay and Primos (see "Creators and Children") [Anodevine]
2. Elia, the god created by Rey. [High Nigh-Anodevine]
3. The Pleroma (plural), a race of gods created by Elia with near-infinite power and knowledge in comparison to all else [Nigh-Anodevine]
4. Sophia, "Wisdom", a powerful member of the Pleroma, creater of Yaldabaoth and the other Yalians(has no knowledge if its actions) [Nigh-Anodevine]
5. The Yalians, the "children" of Sophia.
6. {UN-NAMED}, "Acient of Days", the first of the Yalians [deceased]
7. Kylel, Elder Yalian, expelled.
8. Yaldabaoth, also known as: Yahweh, God, Elohim (from the Cloak of Elohim, uses the skin of the Unamed Yalian and the Ligh of Sophia), Lord, Demiurge, ect., Ruler of Heaven.
9. Khasis, the Architect. Formed the Cloak of Elohim
10. Yarikh, Illuminater of the Heavens, youngest.
